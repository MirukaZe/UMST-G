        "        <li><strong>Merger of Objects (Black Holes or Neutron Stars)</strong><br>During a merger, a new object forms, such as a more massive black hole. At the moment of merger, a powerful burst of energy is released as gravitational waves.</li>\n",
        "        <li><strong>Ringdown of the Newly Formed Object</strong><br>After the merger, the new object oscillates, like a bell after being struck. These oscillations gradually decay, and we analyze this phase.</li>\n",
        "        <li><strong>Why It Matters?</strong><br>Standard General Relativity (GR) predicts only tensor modes (plus and cross). If we detect a scalar mode, it could indicate new physics, such as modifications to gravity.</li>\n",

        "        <li><strong>Scalar-to-Tensor Frequency Ratio</strong><br>Theoretically expected value is 0.73 (red line). Consistent closeness to this value supports the presence of a real scalar mode.</li>\n",
